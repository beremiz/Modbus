/* An unbounded FIFO data structure.
 *
 * The user/caller writes and reads directly from the data structure's buffer,
 * which eliminates slow copying of bytes between the user's and the structure's
 * local memory.
 *
 * The data structure stores the current data linearly in a single memory array,
 * i.e. the current data is stored from start to finish from a low address
 * to a high address, and does *not* circle back to the bottom of the address
 * space as is usual in a circular buffer. This allows the user/caller to
 * pass the structure's own byte array on to other functions such as
 * read() and write() for file operations.
 *
 * The FIFO is implemented by allocating more memory than the maximum number
 * of bytes it will ever hold, and using the extra bytes at the top of the
 * array as the bottom data bytes are released. When we run out of extra bytes,
 * (actually, when the number of un-used bytes at the beginning is larger than
 * a configured maximum), the whole data is moved down, freeing once again the
 * extra bytes at the top of the array.
 *
 * Remember that we can optimize the data structure so that whenever it becomes
 * empty, we can reset it to start off at the bottom of the byte array, i.e. we
 * can set the start = end = 0; instead of simply setting the start = end, which
 * may point to any position in the array.
 *
 * Taking the above into consideration, it would probably be a little more efficient
 * to implement it as a circular buffer with an additional linearize() function
 * the user could call whenever (s)he required the data to be stored linearly.
 * Nevertheless, since it has already been implemented as a linear buffer, and since
 * under normal circumstances the start and end pointers will be reset to 0 quite
 * often (and therefore we get no additional benefit under normal circumstances),
 * we will leave it as it is for the time being...
 *
 *
 * The user is expected to call
 *   lb_init() -> to initialize the structure
 *   lb_done() -> to free the data structure's memory
 *
 * The user can store data starting off from...
 *   lb_free() -> pointer to address of free memory
 *   lb_free_count() -> number of free bytes available
 * and then call
 *   lb_data_add()
 * to add the data to the data structure
 *
 * Likewise, the user can read the data directly from
 *   lb_data() -> pointer to address of data location
 *   lb_free_count() -> number of data bytes available
 * and free the data using
 *   lb_data_purge()
 * to remove the data from the data structure
