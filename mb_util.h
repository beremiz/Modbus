/* This file has constants related to the modbus protocol */
/*
 * Some of these constants are specific to the layer two protocols
 * (i.e. master and slave), while others are specific of the
 * layer one protocols (i.e. rtu, ascii, tcp).
 *
 * a) Unfortunately, due to the nature of the modbus protocol, that does not
 * include a frame size field in the layer 1 frame (see note 1), and the
 * fact that we are implementing it at the user level, the implementation
 * of some layer 1 protocols need to know the content of the layer 2 protocol
 * in order to determine the size of the frame.
 *
 * b) The layer two message formats are in fact the same, just reversing the role
 * being played (master or slave).
 *
 * Bothe a) and b) mean we need the same modbus protocol constants in several files.
 * It ends up making more sense to put them all together in a single file, which
 * makes updating easier, even though we are trying to strictly seperate the layer 1
 * and layer 2 protocols.
 *
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 *  (1) There is no layer 1 field with the frame size, nevertheless this
 *      size can be determined indirectly due to timing restrictions on the rtu
 *      protocol. Unfortunately, due to the fact that we are implementing
 *      it at the user level, we are not guaranteed to detect these timings
 *      correctly, and therefore have to rely on layer 2 protocol info to
 *      determine the frame size.
 *      For the ascii protocol, the frame size is determined indirectly by
 *      a frame header and tail, so we do not use layer 2 protocol info.
